## Description

This project is a backend for a frontend application, serving as a gateway to aggregate and format data from different sources to meet the specific needs of the frontend applications that require it.

The cache module is implemented throughout the entire app by injecting it into the app.module. It allows for efficient caching of data to improve performance. The TTL is set to 1 hour as per the requirements. It can be deactivated or configured from the injection in app.module.ts

The /flights API endpoint in this project has the following features:

1. It merges the results and makes requests in parallel, improving efficiency. When merging the flights and duplicates are found, price is checked to display the cheaper one (Assuming this is meant for costumers to see they may be more interested to buy the cheaper offerings)
2. It waits for a maximum of 750ms for each response to finish to avoid blocking the API response in case of excessive latency. This is done to ensure sub second response time as per the requirements.
3. It handles API errors on data sources and defaults to an empty flights response in such cases, displaying available results and avoiding blocking the API when there are flaky datasources.

I added unit tests in flights.service.specs.ts to test the feature outlined above.

The endpoint can be accessed in the following URL:
http://localhost:3000/flights
